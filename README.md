I finished all tasks up to scene 8 and some bonus tasks.
 
The bonus tasks are shown in scene 0.
I've done:
[+3] Infinite Cylinder
[+5] Blend Reflection
[+5] Motion Blur

The bonus scene may take a bit longer than the rest.
I've included a picture of the bonus scene as well in resources/bonus.png.

I used this source to help code the equations for the cylinder:
